I have created Todo List WebApp using react.js

in that app i have added input fileds like name, description, project status, start date and end date, mobile number, email etc..

I have also added validation also email should be in proper format, mobile number should be 10 integers and did not start with 0, all input fields must be filled.

after creating one alert will come. 

and edit and update option also i have added.

delete option is also created

and Tasks filtered based on project status by clicking button we can filter those tasks.
